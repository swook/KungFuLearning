Import data

Create dictionary of words
	Key:   word      (string)
	Value: occurence (integer)

[Preprocess: reduce noise]
	Reduce duplicates (with minor differences)
		Capitalisation
		Extra characters
		Slightly different order of characters

Each word is a feature

X: MxN where
	M:     No. of data points
	N:     No. of features
	entry: No. of occurence of feature for data point

Y: Mx1 where
	entry is {City code}{Country code} combined

Run ensemble methods (or other multi-class classifier)

[Apply same preprocessing as before to validation set]

Calculate estimations using model
